# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The spaghetti-comb-v2 plugin is designed to help developers untangle complex codebases by visualizing code relationships and dependencies. Building upon the foundation of spaghetti-comb-v1, this plugin provides enhanced code exploration capabilities through a split-window interface that displays relationships between code elements. The system tracks navigation history, analyzes code coupling, and provides intelligent navigation assistance while maintaining high performance and seamless Neovim integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer exploring a complex codebase, I want to see code relationships and dependencies in a dedicated panel, so that I can understand the structure and connections within the code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the relations panel THEN the system SHALL display code relationships for the current symbol/function
2. WHEN I navigate to different symbols THEN the system SHALL update the relations panel with relevant references, definitions, and dependencies
3. WHEN I have multiple branching navigation paths THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish between different exploration branches
4. WHEN the navigation history exceeds a reasonable limit THEN the system SHALL automatically prune older entries while preserving important branch points
5. WHEN jumping around within the same file THEN the system SHOULD prune inconsequential jumps
6. WHEN the system has kept the jump history for more than a configurable amount of time (default to 30m) THEN the system SHALL prune old history
7. WHEN pruning occurs THEN the system SHALL attempt to update jump destinations if line numbers have shifted and mark unrecoverable locations as inactive
8. WHEN pruning is triggered THEN the system SHALL debounce pruning operations by 2 minutes to prevent excessive processing
9. WHEN a location is recovered after line number changes THEN the system SHALL show both the original and current line numbers to the user

### Requirement 2

2. WHEN the navigation history grows large THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance through efficient data structures
3. WHEN I open large files THEN the breadcrumb system SHALL not cause noticeable delays in file loading
4. WHEN the system tracks navigation history THEN it SHALL use minimal memory footprint and avoid memory leaks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer who relies on Neovim's existing functionality, I want the navigation extension to integrate seamlessly with built-in features, so that I can leverage familiar workflows without learning entirely new paradigms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use nvim's built-in jumplist (Ctrl-O, Ctrl-I) THEN the system SHALL integrate with and enhance these existing commands
2. WHEN I use LSP "go to definition" THEN the system SHALL extend the built-in functionality rather than replacing it
3. WHEN I use nvim's built-in marks THEN the system SHALL complement rather than conflict with existing mark functionality
4. WHEN I use telescope or other pickers THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing picker interfaces where appropriate

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer who works across different projects, I want the navigation history to be project-aware, so that navigation trails from different codebases don't interfere with each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch between different projects THEN the system SHALL maintain separate navigation histories for each project
2. WHEN I close and reopen a project THEN the system SHOULD optionally support restoring navigation history in the default OS location
3. WHEN I work in multiple nvim instances THEN each instance SHALL maintain its own navigation context
4. WHEN I want to clear navigation history THEN the system SHALL provide commands to reset history for current project or globally
