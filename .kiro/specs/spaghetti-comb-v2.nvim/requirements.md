# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This plugin extends Neovim's built-in navigation capabilities with a visual, non-obtrusive breadcrumb system that helps developers navigate large codebases efficiently. The system will track navigation history, show branching paths, and provide quick access to previously visited locations while maintaining simplicity and performance. The implementation prioritizes extending Neovim's existing functionality over adding external dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working in a large codebase, I want to see a visual trail of my navigation history, so that I can understand how I arrived at my current location and easily jump around my exploration path.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate between files or functions THEN the system SHALL record each jump in a navigation history
2. WHEN I view the navigation breadcrumbs THEN the system SHALL display the sequence of locations that led to my current position
3. WHEN I have multiple branching navigation paths THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish between different exploration branches using unicode box-drawing characters
4. WHEN the navigation history exceeds a reasonable limit THEN the system SHALL automatically prune older entries while preserving important branch points
5. WHEN jumping around within the same file THEN the system SHOULD prune inconsequential jumps
6. WHEN the system has kept the jump history for more than a configurable amount of time (default to 30m) THEN the system SHALL prune old history
7. WHEN pruning occurs THEN the system SHALL attempt to update jump destinations if line numbers have shifted and mark unrecoverable locations as inactive
8. WHEN pruning is triggered THEN the system SHALL debounce pruning operations by 2 minutes to prevent excessive processing
9. WHEN a location is recovered after line number changes THEN the system SHALL show both the original and current line numbers to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer exploring code relationships, I want to quickly jump to function definitions, implementations, and usage sites, so that I can understand code flow without losing track of where I started.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I trigger "go to definition" THEN the system SHALL extend nvim's built-in LSP functionality and record the jump in navigation history
2. WHEN I trigger "find references" THEN the system SHALL integrate with nvim's built-in reference finding and allow quick navigation between results
3. WHEN I jump to a function implementation THEN the system SHALL record both the source and destination in the breadcrumb trail
4. WHEN I want to see all callers of a function THEN the system SHALL leverage nvim's LSP capabilities to show usage locations and small previews

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer who frequently backtracks during code exploration, I want intuitive controls to navigate backward and forward through my history, so that I can efficiently retrace my steps without manual file switching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to go back to a previous location THEN the system SHALL provide keyboard shortcuts that extend nvim's built-in jumplist functionality
2. WHEN I navigate backward through history THEN the system SHALL update the visual breadcrumbs to reflect my current position in the trail
3. WHEN I want to jump forward after going backward THEN the system SHALL allow forward navigation through previously visited locations
4. WHEN I want to jump to any point in my history THEN the system SHALL provide a quick selection interface using `mini.pick`, if installed, and possible to extend for Telescope or Snacks picker in the future
5. WHEN `mini.pick` is not installed THEN the system SHALL turn off the picker feature
6. WHEN I want to view the complete branch history THEN the system SHALL display a floating window with a visual tree on the left using unicode box-drawing characters and a preview pane on the right
7. WHEN viewing the branch history tree THEN the system SHALL support native vim motions for navigation and show branches sorted by most to least recent
8. WHEN I want to manage bookmarks THEN the picker SHALL have a bookmark management mode with fuzzy filtering by filename or code content, sorted by frecency
9. WHEN I want to navigate quickly THEN the picker SHALL have a navigation mode with the same filtering options but sorted by recency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer who values screen real estate, I want the navigation breadcrumbs to be visually subtle and non-intrusive, so that they enhance my workflow without cluttering my editing environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the breadcrumbs are displayed THEN they SHALL occupy minimal screen space and use subtle visual styling
2. WHEN I want to view breadcrumbs THEN the system SHALL only show them when I press the designated hotkey
3. WHEN breadcrumbs are shown THEN they SHALL collapse information for less recent locations unless focused, similar to mini.files behavior
4. WHEN I focus on a breadcrumb item THEN the system SHALL expand that item and collapse all but the immediate neighboring breadcrumbs
5. WHEN breadcrumbs are not actively being used THEN they SHALL remain hidden to preserve screen real estate

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working with large codebases, I want the navigation system to be fast and responsive, so that it doesn't slow down my development workflow or consume excessive system resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform navigation actions THEN the system SHALL respond within 50ms for local operations
2. WHEN the navigation history grows large THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance through efficient data structures
3. WHEN I open large files THEN the breadcrumb system SHALL not cause noticeable delays in file loading
4. WHEN the system tracks navigation history THEN it SHALL use minimal memory footprint and avoid memory leaks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer who relies on Neovim's existing functionality, I want the navigation extension to integrate seamlessly with built-in features, so that I can leverage familiar workflows without learning entirely new paradigms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use nvim's built-in jumplist (Ctrl-O, Ctrl-I) THEN the system SHALL integrate with and enhance these existing commands
2. WHEN I use LSP "go to definition" THEN the system SHALL extend the built-in functionality rather than replacing it
3. WHEN I use nvim's built-in marks THEN the system SHALL complement rather than conflict with existing mark functionality
4. WHEN I use telescope or other pickers THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing picker interfaces where appropriate

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer who works across different projects, I want the navigation history to be project-aware, so that navigation trails from different codebases don't interfere with each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch between different projects THEN the system SHALL maintain separate navigation histories for each project
2. WHEN I close and reopen a project THEN the system SHOULD optionally support restoring navigation history in the default OS location
3. WHEN I work in multiple nvim instances THEN each instance SHALL maintain its own navigation context
4. WHEN I want to clear navigation history THEN the system SHALL provide commands to reset history for current project or globally

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer who prioritizes maintainability, I want the plugin to have comprehensive test coverage, so that I can trust the functionality and contribute to the project with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is developed THEN it SHALL use mini.test framework for testing high-level behavior
2. WHEN tests are written THEN they SHALL focus on high-signal integration tests rather than exhaustive unit tests
3. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL include corresponding test coverage
4. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL complete quickly and provide clear feedback on functionality

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer who benefits from visual context, I want to see previews of code at different navigation points, so that I can quickly assess whether a location is relevant before jumping to it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the navigation history THEN the system SHALL provide small code previews for each location
2. WHEN previews are displayed THEN they SHALL show relevant context around the target location
3. WHEN I hover over or select a breadcrumb item THEN the system SHALL display a preview pane similar to telescope or mini.files
4. WHEN previews are shown THEN they SHALL be fast to load and not impact navigation performance

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to have a "sticky note" or to "highlight" important jump locations, either automatically detected based on frequency or manually, so that I can quickly access frequently visited or important code locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit a location multiple times within a session THEN the system SHALL automatically mark it as a frequently visited location
2. WHEN I want to manually mark a location as important THEN the system SHALL provide a command to create a sticky bookmark at the current position
3. WHEN viewing navigation history THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish important/frequent locations from regular navigation entries
4. WHEN I want to jump to important locations THEN the system SHALL provide quick access through the picker interface
5. WHEN I want to manage bookmarks THEN the system SHALL provide commands to list, remove, and clear sticky bookmarks

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer who wants to debug issues, I want to optionally be able to turn on a debug log following standard practices and inspect all plugin operations to ensure correct behavior, so that I can troubleshoot problems and contribute to plugin development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log all navigation events, history operations, and UI updates
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture and log error details by default regardless of debug mode
3. WHEN I want to enable debug mode THEN the system SHALL provide a configuration option to turn on verbose logging
4. WHEN debug logs are written THEN they SHALL follow Neovim's standard logging practices and be written to appropriate log locations
5. WHEN I want to inspect plugin state THEN the system SHALL provide commands to dump current history and configuration for debugging

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a developer who wants contextual awareness of my exploration state, I want to see minimal branch information in my statusline, so that I can understand my current navigation context without opening additional windows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am actively exploring with an active branch THEN the statusline SHALL display the branch short identifier, current depth, and minimal necessary information in an extremely concise fashion
2. WHEN I am not actively exploring THEN the statusline SHALL show an idle branching indicator
3. WHEN determining active exploration THEN the system SHALL use a simple algorithm based primarily on time between jumps to differentiate exploration from idle states
4. WHEN displaying statusline information THEN the system SHALL ensure the display is minimal and does not interfere with existing statusline content
