- How do I navigate within the panel?
- How do I hide the panel?
- How do I expand it to handle cut off text?
- How do I handle clearing the panel and replacing the content when same list is appended?
- How do I view the previews? How do I view the call stack?
- How do I reset the callstack when I've gone on to something else in the code base? Could I have multiple parallel explorations to refer to?

- I want breadcrumbs to track the process of exploration visible at all times
- Showing a Window split instead of a panel opens up more opportunities to preserve context and show previews
